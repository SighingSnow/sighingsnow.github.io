I followed the [your-first-webgpu-app](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/your-first-webgpu-app#0.) and finished the course in my spare time. 

And the result is as follows:

The code is quite straightforward, but why I wrote this blog is that I was inspired by the course. 

So, the takeaways are as follows:

* A compute shader is an effective way to leverage the GPU for calculations. Sometimes, we donâ€™t have ready-made solutions for certain scenarios. Reflecting on this reminds me of when I used the CPU for similar calculations in the past. 

* Ping-pong buffer usage: I have occasionally experimented with this type of buffer in my projects. In the past, I relied on approaches involving mutexes or semaphores to manage the pipeline. However, knowing about this buffer and its name earlier could have saved me considerable time. With the proper terminology, I could have directly searched for and adopted useful design patterns instead of reinventing the wheel in a naive way.
